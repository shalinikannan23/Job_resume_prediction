# Resume Classifier using NLP & Machine Learning

An end-to-end machine learning pipeline that automatically classifies resumes into predefined job categories using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.

This project demonstrates:
- Cleaning and processing text using **spaCy**
- Extracting meaningful features using **TF-IDF**
- Training a **Logistic Regression** model for multi-class classification

Itâ€™s an excellent starting point for applied NLP projects.

## ðŸš€ Key Steps

### 1. Text Preprocessing (spaCy)
- Tokenization
- Lowercasing
- Stopword Removal
- Lemmatization

### 2. Feature Extraction
- **TF-IDF Vectorization** to convert cleaned text into numerical feature vectors.

### 3. Model Training
- **Logistic Regression** for multi-class classification of resumes.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Accuracy Score
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
- Predicts job categories from raw resume text
