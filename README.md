# Resume Classifier using NLP & Machine Learning

A simple yet effective machine learning pipeline that automatically classifies resumes into predefined job categories using natural language processing. This project leverages spaCy for text processing and Logistic Regression for classification, making it a great starting point for applied NLP projects.

## Text Preprocessing using spaCy

- Tokenization

- Lowercasing

- Stopword removal

- Lemmatization

### Feature Extraction using TF-IDF

### Model: Logistic Regression for multi-class classification

### Evaluation:

- Accuracy Score

- Classification Report

- Predicts job categories from raw resume text

## Tech Stack

- 🐍 Python 3.x	Programming Language
- 🔠 spaCy	Text preprocessing (en_core_web_sm)
- 📚 Scikit-learn	Model training & evaluation
- 📊 Pandas	Data handling & manipulation
- 🧮 NumPy	Numerical computations

## Project Structure

- Preprocessing: Input resumes are cleaned and lemmatized using spaCy.

- Feature Engineering: The processed text is transformed using TF-IDF Vectorizer.

- Classification:Logistic Regression classifies each resume into a job category.

- Prediction & Evaluation: Outputs model accuracy and a detailed classification report.
